# 03 · History and mythology: direction profile

**Identity:** a cinematic picture book that comes alive. Illustrated storybook scenes with real
camera movement, character animation, parallax depth, dramatic light and controlled transitions.
An animated historical film, never a slideshow.

## Numbers
| | |
|---|---|
| Median shot | 4 s (2.5–8 s); battles 1.5–2.5 s; awe shots up to 8 s |
| Camera | slow push-ins, sweeping pans across kingdoms, tilt-ups on temples and gods, parallax in every painted scene, aerial map moves |
| Animation | characters on twos with weight; capes, hair, flags and smoke with follow-through; squash ≤ 5% |
| Effects max | level 2 (dust, embers, god-rays, fog, glow on divine objects); battles may reach 3 |
| Transitions | straight cut, cross-dissolve, dip to black (chapter ends), ink/paint bleed, map transition, match cut. Pick 3–4 |
| Light | dramatic: strong key, deep shadows, rim light on heroes, warm gold for divine/royal, cold blue for night and loss |
| Sound | ambience bed (wind, bells, river, crowds), regional instruments, drums and choir for turns; L-cuts between scenes |

## Characters first (G3, mandatory)
Before any scene: a spec and an approved reference sheet for every named character. Face, age,
proportions (head-heights), skin, hair, clothing per era, colours (hex), jewellery and weapons,
signature pose, personality. Gods and heroes keep their traditional attributes
(`storytelling.md`). Locked after approval; one version for the whole film.

## Environments
Plan the 3–6 recurring locations (kingdom, temple, forest, battlefield, river, court) as **location
sheets**: architecture of the era, palette, light at different times of day. Reuse the same location
art across scenes so the world stays consistent.

## Building a scene (picture book → film)
1. Paint the scene in layers: sky · far landscape · mid architecture · characters · foreground (leaves, pillars, smoke).
2. Animate layers with parallax (foreground 1.6×, mid 1×, back 0.4×) under a slow camera move.
3. Animate the characters (gesture, walk, cloth), not just the camera.
4. Add atmosphere particles (dust in light, embers, mist).
5. Light it: key light direction fixed per location and time of day.

## Truth labelling
On screen and in narration, separate: **documented history** · **tradition / legend** · **mythology (as told in <text>)**.
A small corner tag works: `HISTORY`, `LEGEND`, `FROM THE MAHABHARATA`.

## Camera rules (history and mythology)
Cinematic and grand: slow, motivated moves that make painted scenes feel like a film.
| Situation | Camera move | Numbers |
|---|---|---|
| Every shot (default) | slow push or pan over a parallax scene | 4–8% per shot; never a still picture |
| Establishing a kingdom, temple or battlefield | wide pan or slow aerial descent | 5–8 s, constant speed |
| Gods, kings, temples | tilt-up (low angle) for power and awe | slow, ease-out |
| Emotion, a decision, a vow | slow push-in to the face | 100 → 112% over 4–6 s |
| Battle | tracking with the hero; short punches on clashes | punch ≤ 10%, light shake ≤ 4 px |
| The turn of the story | slow push-in, then hold the move with silence | |
| Journey across a map | map move along the route line | the camera follows the line as it draws |
| Endings | slow pull-out to wide | 4–6 s |
| Never | handheld shake in calm scenes, fast whips, modern-looking moves | |

## Special planning (G4)
Beat sheet (5–8 beats) with, per beat: date or text reference, location sheet, characters, emotion, turn.

## Checklist
- [ ] Character sheets approved and used unchanged
- [ ] Location sheets used; era-correct architecture and costume
- [ ] Every shot has movement (camera, parallax, character or atmosphere)
- [ ] History / legend / myth clearly labelled; sources and texts listed
- [ ] Respect rules in `storytelling.md` passed

Video types, styles and packaging: `README.md`, `styles.md`, `packaging.md`, `storytelling.md`.

## Devotional / temple narration and music (`scripts/devotionalmix.py`)
For temple stories, festivals and bhakti narration.
- **Voice:** a warm, calm, reverent and devotional style, speed about 0.93, gap 0.5, and `{pause 1.0}{cue sNN}` at each section start. Telugu uses parler (Prakash or Lalitha).
- **Music:** everything is synthesised by the script, with no samples, so it is free for commercial use. It has these layers:
  - a tanpura (Pa · Sa' · Sa' · Sa with jawari buzz) and a quiet Sa–Pa pad, which duck under speech
  - a deep temple bell in the pause before each `sNN` section
  - a pooja hand-bell on `{cue bell…}` and after any line that mentions గంట
  - a short bansuri phrase (S R g P D) before the first word and after the last line, followed by three closing bell strikes
- **Command:** `devotionalmix.py out/voice --out out/<slug>.te.m4a --lufs -16 [--level 0.8–1.3] [--sa 138.6 male / 155.6 female] [--no-flute]`
- The voice starts 7 s into the mix, so shift picture cues by that amount (the script prints the offset).
- **Taste:** the music supports the prayer and never covers words. Never use real recorded chants or film or devotional songs unless the licence is checked and listed in REFERENCES.txt.
